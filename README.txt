Total: 80 / 90

Using a recycler view is an implementation detail (one that we covered in class) not a creative improvement. Verifying inputs is something we asked you to do as part of the write up and not a creative addition.

Checking for duplicate foods is an addition to the app, but a fairly trivial one.
